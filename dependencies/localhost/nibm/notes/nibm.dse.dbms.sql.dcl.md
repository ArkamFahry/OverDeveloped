## DCL means Data Control Language

DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system

EX:

- GRANT - this command gives users access privileges to the database
- REVOKE - this command withdraws the userâ€™s access privileges given by using the GRANT command
