- Twisted pair consists of two conductors (normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together

-   Twisted-pair cable comes in two forms

    -   Unshielded (UTP)
    
	    - Unshielded twisted pair cable has each pair of wires twisted together. Those wires are then wrapped in tubing without any other protection

	        -   Used in phone lines and networks

    -   Shielded (STP)

	    - Shielded twisted pair has individual pairs of wires wrapped in foil which are the wrapped again for double protection
	    
	        -   Used in phone lines and networks  

-   The twisting helps to reduce the interference (noise) and crosstalk.
