-   How to Prevent Cybercrime

    -   Stay Up to Date

        -   Keep your software\'s up to date

        -   Keep yourself up to date about the world of cybercrime so you can have the knowledge about cybercrime.

>  

-   Be Smart with Devices

    -   That computer, smart phone, tablet, and social media site you can't get enough of are also avenues for bad actors to steal data. Each device or site normally has security settings in the form of pins, passwords, and control over who sees your content. Brush up on security features and use them to your advantage.

    -   And, finally, be smart. Don't share passwords, codes or pins with anyone.

>  

-   Don't Go Public If You Can

    -   That free WIFI stores, restaurants, and other public places offer may be free. Keep this in mind: if it's free to you, it's also free to threat actors. Be careful entering any personal information, using apps with passwords or entering login information, because hackers can see what you're doing. The best advice is to steer clear of public WIFI, or simply don't enter any data that can be compromised.

    -   Steer away from any kind of public open network.

>  

-   Don't get phished

    -   If a web site, email, app or a software looks suspicious don't use it.

    -   Don't give any of your personal info to suspicious looking website or email.

>  

-   Minimize Info

    -   It's best to steer away from entering data like birthdates, social security numbers, and any other information tied to your identity. It leaves a digital footprint that hackers love.

    -   So minimize your digital foot print.\
