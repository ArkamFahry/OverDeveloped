Software distribution strategies

-   Commercial

    -   Any program you purchased and got a physical or digital copy of a commercial software. You don't own the software but you have a license for it.

-   Open-source

    -   Usually made available with all its source code

    -   Which allows an entire community of coders to improve, update and modify the program

-   Freeware

    -   The software is distributed to the user for and most of the time it will have embedded advertising and personal data collection

    -   Software has no restrictions while open-source software does apply a few restrictions to the users sometimes

-   Shareware

    -   A variation of freeware, share ware is free for a limited time
