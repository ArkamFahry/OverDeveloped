Software vs Hardware

 

-   Computer software and hardware require each other -- neither can be used on its own

-   Hardware wears out with time, software does not

-   Hardware only understands machine level language. Software takes input in human-readable languages and transforms it to machine level language

-   Software can be easily created, changed or deleted, whereas switching out hardware takes greater skill and is typically more expensive to do.
