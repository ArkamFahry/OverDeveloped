<p>About cybercrimes</p>
<ul>
<li>Most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These types of crimes can be used to target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three categories of cyber crimes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>crimes in which the computing device is the target -- for example, to gain network access;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crimes in which the computer is used as a weapon -- for example, to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crimes in which the computer is used as an accessory to a crime -- for example, using a computer to store illegally obtained data.</p>

<p>Difference between malware and ransomware</p>
<ul>
<li>Malware is the general term for any program that is designed to damage, disrupt, or hack a device. Viruses and ransomware are malware. Ransomware is malicious programs that block access to your device until you pay a ransom fee to its creator. It is often very difficult and expensive to remove.</li>

<li>
<p>Be Smart with Devices</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That computer, smart phone, tablet, and social media site you can't get enough of are also avenues for bad actors to steal data. Each device or site normally has security settings in the form of pins, passwords, and control over who sees your content. Brush up on security features and use them to your advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, finally, be smart. Don't share passwords, codes or pins with anyone.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't Go Public If You Can</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That free WIFI stores, restaurants, and other public places offer may be free. Keep this in mind: if it's free to you, it's also free to threat actors. Be careful entering any personal information, using apps with passwords or entering login information, because hackers can see what you're doing. The best advice is to steer clear of public WIFI, or simply don't enter any data that can be compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steer away from any kind of public open network.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If a web site, email, app or a software looks suspicious don't use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't give any of your personal info to suspicious looking website or email.</p>

<li>
<p>Minimize Info</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's best to steer away from entering data like birthdates, social security numbers, and any other information tied to your identity. It leaves a digital footprint that hackers love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So minimize your digital foot print.\
