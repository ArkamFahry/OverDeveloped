-   Ring topology uses a token to pass information from one computer to the other

-   A token is attached by the sender to the message to identify which computer needs to receive the message

-   As the message moves around each computer examines the token if it identifies the token as it's own it will process the information

-   Examples

    -   Local area networks

    -   Metropolitan area networks

    -   Synchronous optical networks (for telephone and massive data transfers)
