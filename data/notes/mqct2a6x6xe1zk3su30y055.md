-   These signals are transmitted from a device to another in the form of electromagnetic energy.
- There are two types of transmission  media 
	- Guided media 
		- [[twisted_pair_cables|twisted-pair-cables]]
		- [[coaxial_cables|coaxial-cables]]
		- [[optical_fibers|fiber-optic-cables]] 
	- Unguided media 
		- WI-FI 

 

-   Examples
