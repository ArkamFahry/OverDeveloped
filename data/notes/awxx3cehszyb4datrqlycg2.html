<p><strong>Docker</strong> is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products which uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in a <em>container</em> . A container is light weight isolated virtual environment which runs reliably in any environment which has a docker engine.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-we-need-docker">Why do we need docker<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-do-we-need-docker"></a></h4>
<p>Let say you have built some app. Which runs in a weird flavor of Linux  and it's written in COBOL. So lets say your trying to share this app with your friend. But he doesn't even use Linux or he doesn't even know what is COBOL. So he can't use your cool app. So we will  have have t o replicate our environment. We can use a virtual machine to do this which is the OG way to do it. In the VM the hardware is simulated and installed with the required OS and dependencies but because each VM has it's own OS they are bulky, heavy and slow. So you can use a docker container to share your app. Docker containers are the same as VM's but with a key difference is without virtualizing hardware the docker engine virtualized the OS and uses the shared kernel to run the applications. Which means docker containers are faster and light weight than VM's. In simple terms docker is fast, reliable and lightweight virtualization solution.</p>
