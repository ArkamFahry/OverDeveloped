A container is light weight isolated virtual environment which runs reliably in any environment which has a docker engine.\n\n#### Why do we need docker\n\nLet say you have built some app. Which runs in a weird flavor of Linux  and it's written in COBOL. So lets say your trying to share this app with your friend. But he doesn't even use Linux or he doesn't even know what is COBOL. So he can't use your cool app. So we will  have have t o replicate our environment. We can use a virtual machine to do this which is the OG way to do it. In the VM the hardware is simulated and installed with the required OS and dependencies but because each VM has it's own OS they are bulky, heavy and slow. So you can use a docker container to share your app. Docker containers are the same as VM's but with a key difference is without virtualizing hardware the docker engine virtualized the OS and uses the shared kernel to run the applications. Which means docker containers are faster and light weight than VM's. In simple terms docker is fast, reliable and lightweight virtualization solution.\n\n#### The universe of docker\n\n- Docker File\n  - The [[docker_file|docker-file]]  is like DNA it's code which describes how the docker image should be built.\n- Docker Image\n  - The docker image  is a snapshot of the software along with all it's dependencies to the operating system level.\n  - The image is immutable it can be used to spin up multiple containers of the software in the real world.\n- Docker Container\n  - The docker container is the running docker image.\n- Docker Compose\n  - The [[docker_compose|docker-compose]] file is used to deploy multiple docker containers at once.\n\n#### The docker cli and desktop app\n\n- Docker has a a cli to interact with the docker engine\n  - The [[docker_commands|docker-cli-commands]] can be used to build, deploy, kill and do many more things to docker containers.\n- Docker also has desktop apps for Windows, Linux and Mac.  \n","n":0.053}}},{"i":2,"$":{"0":{"v":"Docker File","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n A **docker file** is  a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an docker image.

Some cybercrimes do both.\n\n\n-   These types of crimes can be used to target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks\n\n\n-   Three categories of cyber crimes\n\n    -   crimes in which the computing device is the target \\-- for example, to gain network access;\n\n    -   crimes in which the computer is used as a weapon \\-- for example, to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\n    -   crimes in which the computer is used as an accessory to a crime \\-- for example, using a computer to store illegally obtained data.\n\n-   Types of cybercrime\n\n    -   Phishing Scams\n\n    -   Website Spoofing\n\n    -   Email and internet fraud\n\n    -   Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used)\n\n    -   Theft of financial or card payment data\n\n    -   Theft and sale of corporate data\n\n    -   Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack)\n\n    -   Ransomware attacks (a type of cyberextortion)\n\n    -   Ransomware\n\n    -   Malware\n\n    -   Identity theft\n\n    -   Software piracy\n\n    -   Cyberespionage\n\n>  \n\n-   Difference between malware and ransomware\n\n    -   Malware is the general term for any program that is designed to damage, disrupt, or hack a device. Viruses and ransomware are malware. Ransomware is malicious programs that block access to your device until you pay a ransom fee to its creator. It is often very difficult and expensive to remove.\n\n>  \n\n-   How to Prevent Cybercrime\n\n    -   Stay Up to Date\n\n        -   Keep your software\\'s up to date\n\n        -   Keep yourself up to date about the world of cybercrime so you can have the knowledge about cybercrime.\n\n>  \n\n-   Be Smart with Devices\n\n    -   That computer, smart phone, tablet, and social media site you can't get enough of are also avenues for bad actors to steal data. Each device or site normally has security settings in the form of pins, passwords, and control over who sees your content. Brush up on security features and use them to your advantage.\n\n    -   And, finally, be smart. Don't share passwords, codes or pins with anyone.\n\n>  \n\n-   Don't Go Public If You Can\n\n    -   That free WIFI stores, restaurants, and other public places offer may be free. Keep this in mind: if it's free to you, it's also free to threat actors. Be careful entering any personal information, using apps with passwords or entering login information, because hackers can see what you're doing. The best advice is to steer clear of public WIFI, or simply don't enter any data that can be compromised.\n\n    -   Steer away from any kind of public open network.\n\n>  \n\n-   Don't get phished\n\n    -   If a web site, email, app or a software looks suspicious don't use it.\n\n    -   Don't give any of your personal info to suspicious looking website or email.\n\n>  \n\n-   Minimize Info\n\n    -   It's best to steer away from entering data like birthdates, social security numbers, and any other information tied to your identity. It leaves a digital footprint that hackers love.\n\n    -   So minimize your digital foot print.\\\n         \n\n>  \n>\n>  \n>\n>  \n","n":0.042}}},{"i":109,"$":{"0":{"v":"Cost of Networking","n":0.577},"1":{"v":" \n\n-   Network Hardware, Software and Setup Cost\n\n-   Data security concerns\n\n-   Computer hacking\n\n-   Virus attacks\n\n-   Equipment malfunction\n\n-   System failures\n","n":0.236}}},{"i":110,"$":{"0":{"v":"Computer Hacking","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\nComputer Hacking\n \n\n-   What is computer hacking?\n\n    -   Computer hacking, on one hand, describes the activities practiced by individuals, organizations, and nations, in order to gain unauthorized access to computer and technology dependent systems. \n\n    -   These activities may involve the modification or alteration of system\\'s software and hardware in order to perform activities neither purposed by the creator nor in line with the creator\\'s original intentions.\n\n    - Computer hacking is a [[cyber_crimes|cyber-crime]]\n\n\n-   Types of computer hacking attacks\n\n    -   Bait and Switch\n\n        -   Using Bait and Switch hacking technique, an attacker can buy advertising spaces on the websites. Later, when a user clicks on the ad, he might get directed to a page that's infected with malware. This way, they can further install malware or adware on your computer.\n\n\n-   Cookie theft\n\n    -   The cookies in our browser store personal data such as browsing history, username, and passwords for different sites we access. Once the hacker gets access to your cookie, he can even authenticate himself as you on a browser.\n\n-   Virus, Trojan, etc.\n\n    -   Viruses or Trojans are malicious software programs that get installed into the victim's system and keep sending the victim's data to the hacker. They can also lock your files, serve fraud advertisement, divert traffic, sniff your data, or spread on all the computers connected to your network.\n\n\n1.  Phishing\n\n    -   Phishing is a hacking technique using which a hacker replicates the most-accessed sites and traps the victim by sending that spoofed link. Combined with social engineering, it becomes one of the most commonly used and deadliest attack vectors.\n\n    -   Once the victim tries to login or enters some data, the hacker gets the private information of the target victim\n\n\n5.  Denial of Service (DoS\\\\DDoS)\n\n    -   A Denial of Service attack is a hacking technique of taking down a site or server by flooding that site or server with a huge amount of traffic so that the server is unable to process all the requests in real-time and finally crashes down.\n\n\n6.  Keylogger\n\n    -   A keylogger is a simple software that records the key sequence and strokes of your keyboard into a log file on your machine.

For Example, STUD_NO is the candidate key for relation STUDENT.\n>- The candidate key can be simple (having only one attribute) or composite as well. For Example, {STUD_NO, COURSE_NO} is a composite candidate key for relation STUDENT_COURSE.\n>- No, of candidate keys in a Relation are nC(floor(n/2)),for example if a Relation have 5 attributes i.e. R(A,B,C,D,E) then total no of candidate keys are 5C(floor(5/2))=10.\n\n_\n\n>⚠️ Note\n>\n>In SQL Server a unique constraint that has a nullable column, allows the value ‘null‘ in that column only once.

In order to uniquely identify rows of a table, combination of two or more columns/attributes can be used.\n\nEx: User relation can have a composite key of User_Full_Name + Phone_Number bot values combined can identify and access a user\n\n>⚠️ Note\n>\n> It still can give duplicate values in rare cases. So , we need to find the optimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify rows in a table\n\n_\n\n>ℹ️ Info\n>\n>- It acts as a primary key if there is no primary key in a table\n>- Two or more attributes are used to together to make a composite key.\n>- Different combinations of attributes may give different accuracy in terms of identifying the rows uniquely.\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":133,"$":{"0":{"v":"Types of Attributes","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- ## Simple attribute\n\nAn attribute that cannot further subdivided into more components is a simple attribute.\n\nEx: Employee id number, NIC number.\n\n- ## Composite attribute\n\nAn attribute that can be split into components is a composite attribute.\n\nEx: The house address can be split into house number, street number, city, state, country, The name can be split into given name, middle name, family.\n\n>ℹ️ Info\n>\n>Composite attributes will be divided into simple attributes to conserve atomicity.\n\n- ## Single valued attribute\n\nThe attribute which takes up only a single value to represent for each entity instance is a single valued attribute.\n\nEx: The age of student.\n\n- ## Multi value attributes\n\nThe attribute which takes up more than a single value to represent for each entity instance is a multi valued attribute.\n\nEx: Multiple phone number of user: Landline and mobile number, Emails of a user: Work and personal email.\n\n>ℹ️ Info\n>\n>In normalization these multi value attributes will be extracted to a different relation to conserve atomicity.\n\n- ## Derived attribute\n\nAn attribute that can be derived from other attributes is derived attributes\n\nExample: Total average marks of a student, User date of birth derived by age.\n\n>ℹ️ Extra Info\n>\n> These attributes will generated by taking other attributes as input most of the time auto generated.\n\n- ## Key attribute\n\nKey attributes are those attributes that can uniquely identify the entity in the entity set\n\nEx: Enrollment No is the key attribute because it can uniquely identify the student, NIC number also can uniquely identify the student\n\n---\n\n- ## Complex attribute\n\nThose attributes, which can be formed by the nesting of composite and multi-valued attributes, are called **Complex Attributes**.\n\n>⚠️ Info\n>\n> These attributes are rarely used in DBMS(DataBase Management System).

Hence, we can say that if we use both $P$ and $Q$ together we can derive all the attributes of the table. i.e, $P,Q,R,S$.(since $P -> P$ and $Q -> Q$ is self explanatory).\n\nWe can write $PQ = \\{P,Q,R,S\\}$, or in simple words, we can say the closures of $P$ and $Q$ give us all the attribute of the relation.. The minimal sets like $PQ$ in a relation(table) that are capable of deriving all the attributes of a relation(table) are called Candidate keys. There can be more than one candidate key in a table.\n\nIf an attribute is a part of any candidate key of the relation, then it is called a Primary attribute else, it is said to be a Non-Primary attribute. In the example above, we can say that $P$ and $Q$ are primary attributes, and $R$ and $S$ are non-primary attributes.\n\nWe now know the basic definitions required to understand the concept of partial dependency. In the above example, $S$ is dependent on all the primary attributes, i.e.,$P$ and $Q$. If either $P$ or $Q$ are missing, then we cannot derive $S$. In the case of $R$, it is not the same.\n\nEven if $P$, a primary attribute, is missing, we can still derive $R$ using only $S$. Hence, instead of depending totally on the candidate key, $R$ is partially dependent on $Q$, part of a candidate key. This is the concept of partial dependency.\n\n### What Causes Partial Dependency to Occur?\n\nAs we saw in the above section, partial dependency occurs whenever a non-prime attribute depends functionally on a part of the given candidate key.\n\nIn other words, Partial Dependency occurs when an attribute in a table depends on only a part of the primary key and not the whole key.\n\nA functional dependency denoted as $X→Y$ where\n$X$ and $Y$ are an attribute set of a relation, is a partial dependency , if some attribute $A∈X$ can be removed and the dependency still holds.\n\nLet us take an example, consider an example of a College. A student studies in a course, and every student in the college has a unique EnRollNo number.\n\n|Course|EnRollNo|Name|\n|---|---|---|\n|DSE|CODSE22.2-01|Ashwak|\n|CSE|CODSE22.2-02|Dulein|\n|DCSD|CODSE22.2-03|Niven|\n|DNE|CODSE22.2-04|Nazar|\n|BSC|CODSE22.2-05|Arkam|\n\nSuppose you are a student at this college. If a professor asks you to go and give a notebook to the student who has a EnRollNo. CODSE22.2-01, you can quickly identify the student by observing his/her roll. no., i.e.,$CODSE22.2-01$ he is from 2022 Second batch in Diploma In Software Engineering and His student Number is O1\n\nHence, you can successfully give him/her the notebook. You don't even need to know the Course that s/he is pursuing because you can easily determine it with his/her unique Roll. No.\n\nIn other words, if someone provides you with a just the $EnRollNo$, you can quickly tell the student's name. A $EnRollNo$ alone is sufficient to identify or know the student's name.

That means that subsets of $PQR$ like $PQ$, $QR$, $P$, $Q$, etc cannot determine $S$.\n\n### Lets Understand full functional dependency shall we\n\nLet us take an example, consider an example of a school. A student studies in a class, and in each class, every student has a unique StdNo number (key point StdNo is globally not unique it is only unique in the Class domain).\n\n|Class|StdNo|Name|\n|---|---|---|\n|10|11|Ashwak|\n|9|32|Niven|\n|9|17|Dulein|\n|8|32|Mr.Nobody|\n\nSuppose you are a student at this school.
